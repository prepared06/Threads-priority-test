# Threads-priority-test
It was for one of five laboratory works. The application has two fields in which the text is displayed. 
We set different thread priorities, to fill in the fields with the symbols. With different priorities of
the streams, the fields will not be filled in the same way. When you turn off text output, in the missing
field, fill in the text to the level of another field because of the features of the threads in the CLR environment.
